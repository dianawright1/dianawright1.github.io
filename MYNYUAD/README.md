"MY NYUAD" is the name of my website. My intention with this website was to provide a platform for the student body to view events and activities taking place on campus.
Being a new student at NYUAD, I was surprised to see that there were so many events happening every day that I was completely unaware of. 
Of course, as students, we receive emails and newsletters about significant events occurring on campus, but it can be quite challenging to stay on top of everything when you get so many emails and notifications each day. 
There are posters promoting events all throughout campus, but sometimes I'm racing around so much that I don't even look up from my phone to see all of the wonderful posters in the elevators.
Creating ONE platform specifically designed for the student body with a schedule of the events going on seemed like a great idea to me. 

When designing this website, I really wanted the site to feel fun and cheery. 
I am someone who LOVES color and takes much pride in incorporating as many colors as possible into my daily routine.
It was only natural for me to make this website incredibly colorful and aesthetically pleasing. 
While searching online for fonts, I came across this custom font called “Kabond”.
I fell in love with the font and had to include it in the design for the site. I wanted “MY NYUAD” to be a fun, modern, and vibrant site that would excite those viewing the platform. 

Throughout this entire process, I experienced numerous trials and errors. 
I had to do a lot of research to figure out how to write the functions I wanted to include.
I had to rework several of my design choices because I was unsure about the colors to use on the site, as well as push myself to keep the site interesting.
Even with all that being said, I really loved how the website came out and will probably continue re-working it, since it really is a project I am interested in pursuing further! 
Thank you for your help in this process!!
