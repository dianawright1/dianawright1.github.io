        <p> A website created by students for students! We aim to use this platform to inform the NYUAD student body about activities happening on campus in the upcoming semesters! Additionally, this website seeks to help first-year students get a feel for campus life and the many social activities available. 



        We understand the effort each of you has made to get here as well as the effort you make in your classes and other commitments. This website is intended to help you unwind and enjoy everything that university has to offer. That being said, we wish you nothing but the best for the next four years and anticipate seeing you soon.
